    "Given an array A, we can perform a pancake flip: We choose some positive integer k <= A.length, then reverse the order of the first k elements of A.  We want to perform zero or more pancake flips (doing them one after another in succession) to sort the array A.\n",

    "ok so a piece of this I missed that could have led to a cleaner solution is that each element of the list will be somewhere between 1 and the list's length. this means we could use the indices of the list to help us out, but i didn't do that. What made the most sense to me was finding the biggest item, flipping it to the front, and then flipping the entire list so it gets to the back. Once you've done that, you can approach the list as 1 element shorter than before, so that you don't mess with that last sorted element. if the largest element is already in the correct spot, you don't want to flip anything. The flip itself just requires reversing some portion of the list. \n",
    "\n",
    "This process is super inefficient because you need to loop through the whole list and then loop again each time to find the largest element, so it's O(N^2). the space used is to track the number of flips, which can't be more than twice the number of elements in the list, which reduces to O(N).
