    "Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.\n",

    "Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is an interesting one to think of as a dp program. As we know, it can be done with a single counter instead of a table (in this case an array), so adding that element feels like an unnecessary complication, but it was actually a pretty useful thought exercise. The logic piece is the same: looping from the front of the list, check if the current maxsum + the next number is < the current sum: if so, the past elements are not in the max subarray, so the maxsum should be updated to be the new number. otherwise, the new number can simply be added to maxsum and you can continue. To dp this, instead of keeping a counter you can keep an array of the max sum at each index, and then return the max element in that array. For example:\n",

    "input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]\n",

    "```\n",
    "the max element is 6 at index 6, the end of the largest subarray.\n",
    "However, this unnecessarily adds O(n) space into a solution that works iteratively with O(1) space, so it's not an ideal solution. But it's a great starting point for dp thinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this DP solution, you loop through the list once to get the sums, and then again to get the max of your answers ==> O(n + n --> n). the max taken within the loop is constant time because it is always just comparing 2 numbers. As mentioned, the space is O(n)."

This means that we can keep track of the table above, filled with answers, if we first fill in the givens of the top row and left column, and fill in from the top row and left column from there.

If you hit an obstacle, you can't go around it and still only move down and right. Once your grid is instantiated, you also have to make sure not to update obstacle cells in your grid, but instead leave them as 0. Otherwise, however, the logic stays the same. For the number of paths to a cell, you still add the paths to the cell above and to the left of it. obstacles are just 0s in this math. \n",

So basically, in order to compute the final amount, you need to compute each amount before it. therefore, you should have an array tracking the number of coins needed for each number from 0 cents up to (and including) the given amount, therefore your arrays's size should be `amount + 1` and it should be instantiated with each element as infinity. The known element is that it takes 0 coins to make 0 cents, so we can update our array's first element to be 0. Then, for each coin, we can go from the index at that coin's amount to the end of the array and set that element to min(array[i], array[i - coin] + 1). since we're starting from the front of the array, the first time through this loop for each coin will be the index at that coin's worth, which means you can achieve that amount by using that coin once. array[i - coin] when i == coin is index 0, which we set to the value 0. so array[coin] will be set to 1 for each coin. From there, for the first coin, it will build on that and each index at which index % coin == 0 will be updated as array[index - coin] + 1. then it will do the same thing with the next coin, but now many more [index - coin]s will have been filled by the previous coin, and thus be accessible for adding this new coin to. so for example, say your coins are [1, 2, 5] and your amount is 11. \n",
