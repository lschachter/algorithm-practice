2019 leetcode study practice questions/answers

This repository will track all of the leetcode problems I finish correctly as I practice for my job search.
They are sorted by topic and grouped together as needed (linked lists, stacks, and queues together, for example).
Each solution will state 
- the prompt
- my thought process (including at least one example I walked through), 
- the code itself,
- a brief discussion of time and space complexity.

Each problem was written out by hand, where I originally wrote out my thoughts, tested examples, and wrote pseudocode.
This tracks the finished products of each attempt for me to look back at as I acquire new methods of deducing what type of problem I'm looking at.
